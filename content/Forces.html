So here is a link to Building Blaster: try your hand at knocking down some of the block towers.</span></h1><h1 class="P2"><a id="a__About_Inertia"><span/></a><span class="T3">About Inertia</span></h1><p class="P5_borderStart"/><p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"/><span class="T6">The subject of mechanics is subdivided into three areas. </span><span class="T7">Kinetics </span><span class="T6">is the study of how things move. We have discovered that position, velocity, and acceleration as functions of time are all the concepts that are necessary to completely describe how any object in the universe moves. </span><span class="T7">Statics </span><span class="T6">is the study of things that are not moving. Building Blaster begins with a static, stationary construction, but it takes only a few of the more interesting constructions of Building Blaster to recognize that statics is certainly a science in its own right. (Think architecture and civil engineering.) The third field of mechanics is</span><span class="T7"> dynamics</span><span class="T6">: the study of why things move, or don’t move. Dynamics is the subject of this topic on forces.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Imagine a book sitting on a table. How it is moving is easy to describe, because it isn’t. Its position as a function of time is constant; its velocity and acceleration are both zero. The motion diagram consists of a single picture, and a graph of position versus time is a horizontal line. The velocity and acceleration graphs are both horizontal lines on the x-axis, and its equation of motion is simply d = constant.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">If that is the description of how the book is moving, we can then ask, why is the book at rest? At first, the question may seem like nonsense. The book is at rest because it has been at rest, and without any external actions we expect it to stay at rest. It is our human experience that objects at rest stay at rest, and no explanation is needed as to why.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Now consider a toy car rolling across a level floor with a constant velocity (in a straight line at constant speed). Why is it doing that?</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Before even attempting an explanation, here is the correct answer: the car is moving with a constant velocity because that is what the toy car is supposed to be doing, just as much as the book is supposed to be at rest. If ‘because it is supposed to do that’ is an acceptable answer for the book, then it is an equally acceptable answer for the toy car.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">That was the genius of Newton in the </span><span class="T7">Principia</span><span class="T6">. He recognized the principle of inertia, which translated from the Latin means laziness. Physical objects will naturally keep on doing what they have been doing: if the object has been at rest, it will continue to be at rest; if in motion, then the object will stay in motion. In other words, uniform motion doesn’t have to be explained, but</span><span class="T7"> changes </span><span class="T6">in motion do need to be explained.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Consider a tennis ball rolling across a floor. In order to change its motion (speed or direction), one could kick it. Now consider a shot put, which is about the same size as the tennis ball, rolling at the same speed across the floor. Clearly, it will take a much stronger kick to change its motion in the same way. The shot put has more inertia than the tennis ball, or a stronger tendency to keep on doing what it had been doing. It will be harder to start it moving from rest, but also harder to return it from the new motion back to rest.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3_borderEnd"><span class="T6">The measure of inertia is mass. Inertia is the quality, and mass is the quantity. This is no different from recognizing that dimension is the quality while length and width are the quantities, or duration is the quality while time is the quantity.</span></p><p class="Standard"> </p><h1 class="P2"><a id="a__About_Forces"><span/></a><span class="T4">About Forces</span></h1><p class="P1_borderStart"><span class="T9">Key Concept: Forces cause accelerations.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">A change in motion is a change in velocity, and acceleration is defined as a change in velocity over time. So the question </span><span class="T6">should been refined from ‘why do objects move?’ to ‘what causes acceleration?’</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Forces cause accelerations. A force is a push or a pull. Forces are vectors, since direction makes a difference. The unit of force in the SI system is the Newton. Forces exist apart from the accelerations the may cause; for example, the blocks in Building Blaster remain in position because of forces. Newton also recognized another condition concerning force that is fundamental but rarely deduced: forces always come in pairs.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T8">Types of forces</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">A force diagram is a picture showing the actions of all vector forces on an object. The sum of all the force vectors acting on the object is the net force. A net force results in an acceleration, which will act in the same direction as the net force.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Understanding the dynamics of the physical universe becomes tricky because there are a number of different types of forces, each with their own peculiar characteristics. Part of the frustration of ‘doing’ dynamics problems is correctly applying the rules for these forces to the situation at hand.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Here are four important types of forces often encountered in the real world.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T7">Gravitational force</span><span class="T6"> is also known as weight. Any object with mass will have a weight at the surface of the earth. Weight is proportional to mass:</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T6">F</span><span class="T10">g</span><span class="T6"> = mg</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">where g is the gravitational constant, or the acceleration of gravity near the surface of the earth. The direction of the gravitational force is always vertically downward.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">A </span><span class="T7">normal force</span><span class="T6"> is a contact force, meaning it only exists when two objects are touching. Normal forces are also reactive </span><span class="T6">forces, meaning the magnitude and direction will always match the applied net force in order to prevent an acceleration.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Here is an example. Imagine a book with a weight of 3 Newtons resting on a table. The table is in contact with the book. The book is not accelerating. The table applies a normal force of 3 Newtons upward (the direction of the weight is downward) to prevent the book from accelerating.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Now a 2 Newton brick is placed on top of the book, causing a total force of 5 Newtons downward. The normal force of the table is now 5 Newtons upward.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">The word ‘normal’ has nothing to do with psychology, as in normal and abnormal. Normal is a very old term used by mathematicians that means ‘perpendicular’. The direction of a normal force is always perpendicular to the surface.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T7">Frictional forces</span><span class="T6"> are also reactive forces. Friction always acts in a direction opposite to the motion, or the attempt at motion. Static friction prevents an object from moving; kinetic friction attempts to slow down and stop moving objects. Logically, static friction must always be greater than or equal to kinetic friction.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">The magnitude of friction is proportional to the normal force causing it. The ‘conversion factor’ between the two is the coefficient of friction.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T7">Tension</span><span class="T6"> exists in ropes, strings and wires, and is always a pull. The direction of tension is the direction of the wire. Tension does not have a fixed direction but acts in both directions of the wire. Tension can change the direction of a force, but the magnitude within a rope segment must be constant. Tension, in fact, is not actually a vector with a magnitude and a direction, but a tensor, which is the next class of mathematical objects after scalars and vectors.</span></p><p class="P5_borderEnd"/><h1 class="P2"><a id="a__The_First_Law_of_Motion"><span/></a><span class="T4">The First Law of Motion</span></h1><p class="P3_borderStart"><span class="T12">An object at rest stays at rest, or travels in a straight line with a constant speed, unless acted on by a net (or unbalanced) force.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Let’s consider this statement, one phrase at a time. Travelling in a straight line with a constant speed is the definition of uniform motion, or constant velocity. Rest is a special case of constant velocity when the magnitude of the velocity is zero. So an object moves with uniform motion unless acted on by a net force. But non-uniform motion is by definition accelerated motion, so</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T7">Forces cause accelerations</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Because objects want to keep on doing what they have been doing, the First Law is called the Law of Inertia.</span></p><p class="P9"/><p class="P9_borderEnd"/><h1 class="P2"><a id="a__The_Second_Law_of_Motion"><span/></a><span class="T4">The Second Law of Motion</span></h1><p class="P6_borderStart"/><p class="P3"><span class="T12">The acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">In mathematical notation,</span></p><p class="P5"/><p class="P1"><span class="T6">a α F</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">means ‘acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force’.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">In the same way,</span></p><p class="P5"/><p class="P1"><span class="T6">a α 1/m</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">means ‘acceleration is inversely proportional to mass’.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">These two statements can be combined as</span></p><p class="P5"/><p class="P1"><span class="T6">a α F/m</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">since holding either constant reverts to the two simpler forms. </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">A proportionality can be replaced by an equal sign by adding a constant</span></p><p class="P5"/><p class="P1"><span class="T6">a = kF/m</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">If measuring acceleration in m/s/s, mass in kg, and force in N,</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">then the value of k = 1 so</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T6">a = F/m</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3_borderEnd"><span class="T6">or                                                               </span><span class="T9">F = ma</span></p><h1 class="P2"><a id="a__The_Third_Law_of_Motion"><span/></a><span class="T4">The Third Law of Motion</span></h1><p class="P6_borderStart"/><p class="P3"><span class="T12">For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</span><span class="T6"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Forces don’t suddenly appear out of nowhere; they are the result of an interaction between two objects. An</span><span class="T7"> action </span><span class="T6">is another word for force. The Third Law states that forces always come in pairs, and that the two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">It is helpful to express this statement mathematically, as:</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T6">F</span><span class="T11">12</span><span class="T6"> = - F</span><span class="T11">12</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">The subscripts ‘1’ and ‘2’ stand for the two interacting objects, the equal sign means the same magnitude, and the minus sign means opposite directions.

For example, a book is resting on a table. If that is the action, what is the reaction. The two objects are the book and the table. Therefore, by the Third Law, the force of the book acting on the table is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force of the table acting on the book.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Sometimes forces are equal and opposite because of the Third Law, but sometimes they are equal and opposite because of the Second Law. For example, the book on the table is at rest (not accelerating). The weight of the book is equal and opposite to the normal force, but this is not an action and reaction. A Third Law pair always involves forces acting on two different objects; a Second Law pair involves two forces acting on the same object.</span></p><p class="P10_borderEnd"/><h1 class="P2"><a id="a__The_Law_of_Gravity"><span/></a><span class="T4">The Law of Gravity</span></h1><p class="P5_borderStart"/><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Isaac Newton proposed three independent theories in the</span><span class="T7"> Principia</span><span class="T6">. First, he presented the three laws of motion. Second, he proposed the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: that the process of differentiation (finding slopes of lines) and integration (calculating areas under curves) are inverse processes that ‘undo’ each other. Third, he explained his theory of gravity.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Objects have inertial mass, which resists changes in motion. But objects with inertial mass also possess gravitational mass. Gravitational mass results in an interaction between two objects resulting in an attractive gravitational force.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Newton  believed that the gravitational force was proportional to each of the gravitational masses. In other words, doubling the mass of either object would double the force; doubling the masses of both objects would quadruple the force. But in addition, he also posited that the gravitational force was inversely proportional to the square of the distance between </span><span class="T6">the two objects. For example, increasing the separation distance by a factor of three would decrease the force to one-ninth the original value.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">The inverse square relationship is found in many fundamental relationships in the physical sciences. Electrical force is also inverse square, and also the intensity of light from a point-like object (how bright it appears).</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Newton believed his mathematical relationship for gravity was correct because he could use it, coupled with the three laws and his calculus, to derive Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion. This process, once again, brings us back to the fourth point of his natural philosophy: that the universe can be explained by applying mathematical principles to a few relatively simple relationships. But because the gravitational force is so small, it took almost a century for another scientist, Henry Cavendish, to demonstrate that the mathematical relationship was correct.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T13"> </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Newton’s law of gravity combined with the second law also explains why gravitational acceleration is constant near the surface of the earth. The gravitational force acting on a ball depends on the mass of the ball, the mass of the earth, and the distance between the center of the ball and the center of the earth. But the acceleration of the ball when released also depends on the mass of the ball. Therefore, doubling the mass of the ball doubles the force acting on the ball, but it also doubles its resistance to changes in motion and these two effects cancel out. Meanwhile, the mass of the earth is constant and the separation distance between the ball and the center of the earth is effectively constant. Include the universal constant that converts between masses, distance and resulting force, and the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m/s/s) could be calculated directly from their values.</span></p><p class="P3_borderEnd"><span class="T6">  </span></p><h1 class="P2"><a id="a__The_Structure_of_the_Mechanical_Universe"><span/></a><span class="T4">The Structure of the Mechanical Universe</span></h1><p class="P5_borderStart"/><p class="P3"><span class="T6">Gravitational mass is a </span><span class="T7">property </span><span class="T6">of an object, resulting in a gravitational interaction.

Possessing such knowledge is clearly impossible, and reality turned out to be a bit more complicated than that, but even so, this is still our basic model for describing the universe.</span></p><p class="P3_borderEnd"/></body></html>
