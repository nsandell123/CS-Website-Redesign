In physics, we write down equations that summarize the relationships between quantities such as position, velocity, acceleration, force, or energy. Each equation is a shorthand that summarizes our observations or experience. In chemistry, we also write down equations that summarize the nature of the change. The general name given for a change in composition is a reaction; the shorthand statement is a chemical equation.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T1">Chemical Equations</span></p><p class="Standard">An equal sign in a mathematical equation implies that the quantities on the two sides of the equal sign are the same and mathematically identical. Because a chemical equation does not involve mathematical operations like multiplication or subtraction, an arrow is used instead of an equal sign. The arrow shows the progression of the change, from the initial state – the reactants – to the final state – the products.</p><p class="Standard">Sometimes reactions are reversible. For example, depending on the conditions, ice can melt to form water, or water can freeze to form ice. Or consider a condition necessary to stay alive: breathing. Oxygen can bond to hemoglobin in the lungs, but it is released in the body’s cells. In a similar way. Carbon dioxide bonds to hemoglobin in the cells but is released in the lungs. If it weren’t for the continual actions of attach and release, life could not function as it does.</p><p class="Standard">In some situations, both reactants and products are always present, and the relative amounts of reactants and products can be adjusted by slight changes in conditions. This type of situation is called chemical equilibrium and will be explored briefly in the unit on water. The chemical equation is called a reversible reaction, and a double arrow is used to show that while reactants are being converted into products, at the same time products are being converted into reactants. </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T1">Balancing Reactions</span></p><p class="Standard">Antoine Lavoisier provided experimental evidence to show that mass is conserved in a chemical change. Chemical theory goes one step further: with a few exceptions that go beyond classical chemistry, not only is mass conserved in a chemical reaction but the atoms themselves as well. Nature doesn’t create or destroy atoms (usually) but only re-arrange them by breaking old chemical bonds and making new ones. Therefore, in a chemical equation, the number of each type of atom on the two sides of the arrow must be the same for the reaction to be ‘balanced’.</p><p class="Standard">It is also true that electric charge is conserved. Therefore, if a reaction includes ions, the total amount of charge on both sides of the balanced equation must be the same.</p><p class="Standard">The primary learning outcome of this unit is learning how to balance chemical equations. An equation is balanced when the number of each type of atom on both sides of the equation are the same. The number of atoms represented by a substance of the product of the number of atoms in the chemical formula and the coefficient, which is the number in front of the formula.  For example:</p><p class="P1">2 H<span class="T2">2(g)</span> + 1 O<span class="T2">2(g)</span> <span class="T3"></span> 2 H<span class="T2">2</span>O<span class="T2">(l)</span></p><p class="Standard">Each hydrogen molecule is composed of two atoms bonded together. There are a total of four hydrogen atoms on the reactant side because 2 x 2 = 4. In the same way, there are two oxygen atoms because 1 x 2 = 2. There are four hydrogen atoms on the product side because each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms are the coefficient in from of the water term is two. There is no subscript for the oxygen in the formula for water, which implies a value of “1”, and 1 x 2 = 2 oxygen atoms on the product side. Thus, both sides of the equation have four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, so the equation is balanced.</p><p class="Standard">This chemical equation also includes phase labels. Both the hydrogen and oxygen reactants are in the gas phase, and the water is in the liquid phase. The other two phase labels in chemical equations are “s” for solids and “aq” for aqueous, which means dissolved in water. Ions are always aqueous.</p><p class="Standard">This chemical equation could also have been written as </p><p class="P1">H<span class="T2">2(g)</span> + ½ O<span class="T2">2(g)</span> <span class="T3"></span> H<span class="T2">2</span>O<span class="T2">(l)</span></p><p class="Standard">Two changes have been made. First, if no coefficient is included, it is assumed to be ‘1”. Second, it is not required that coefficients are whole numbers. This is because the coefficients can refer to moles of the substances and not individual molecules. In the example given, each side of the equation has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The equation could have also been written with coefficients of 4, 2 and 4, in order from left to right, and still be balanced. But general practice is to use the smallest set of integers with no common multiples.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Balancing chemical equations can only be learned through practice. There are some useful suggestions, however, to make the task easier.</p><ol><li><p class="P4" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">1.</span>Never change a chemical formula. Doing so changes the composition of the substance and thus the substance itself.<span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P4" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">2.</span>Once a coefficient has been determined, don’t change it. If it becomes necessary to change a coefficient, just start over.<span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P4" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">3.</span>Always write down a “1” if that is the coefficient. Don’t leave it as implied, since then you can’t be sure if that term has been balanced yet or not.<span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P4" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">4.</span>Start with one coefficient in from of one chemical formula. Try to choose a substance that includes an element that is found in only two places: one substance that is a reactant and one that is a product. Avoid balancing elements first that are in multiple locations. (Oxygen often has this trait in many common reactions.)<span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P4" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">5.</span>It is also helpful to move back and forth between reactants and products. For example, suppose sodium, Na, is found in only one substance on each side of the chemical equation. Suppose the product is sodium chloride, NaCl, and the coefficient is ‘2”. That means there are two chlorine atoms on the product side. If chlorine is only located in that product, then there must be two chlorine atoms on the reactant side. Choose the coefficient(s) on the reactant side to make that true. With those new coefficients, there must be other elements with known numbers of reactant atoms that must be balanced by product atoms, etc.<span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P4" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">6.</span>The process is finished when the last unknown coefficient is assigned. Usually, there is an internal self-check to see if the balance is correct. For example, perhaps the last coefficient determines the total number of oxygen atoms on that side of the equation. Then counting oxygen atoms on each side will determine if the balance is correct. Balancing equations never requires an outside reference to determine if the result is correct or not.<span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li></ol><p class="List_20_Paragraph"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T1">Types of Reactions</span></p><p class="Standard">It can be helpful to classify reactions into general categories. Here are some standard types. The labels for these different types of reactions, unfortunately, are not standardized.

For example, upon heating, calcium carbonate (chalk) decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide:</p><p class="P1"> CaCO<span class="T2">3(s)</span> <span class="T3"></span> CaO<span class="T2">(s)</span> + CO<span class="T2">2(g)</span></p><p class="List_20_Paragraph">Calcium oxide is also known as quicklime.

Therefore, iron rusting or silver tarnishing are examples of combustion reactions, even though there is no heat or fire. Most combustion reactions, however, involve organic compounds, like methane:</p><p class="P6"><br/>1 CH<span class="T2">4(g)</span> + 2 O<span class="T2">2(g)</span> <span class="T3"></span> 1 CO<span class="T2">2(g) + </span>2 H<span class="T2">2</span>O<span class="T2">(l)</span></p><p class="List_20_Paragraph"> </p><p class="List_20_Paragraph">The products of combustion with an organic substance are <span class="T1">always</span> carbon dioxide and water.

The most likely observation that deomonstrates something has occurred is the formations of a new solid compound, called a precipitate. Two clear solutions that become cloudy when mixed is evidence of a precipitate. Here is an example:</p><p class="List_20_Paragraph"> </p><p class="P6">CaCl<span class="T2">2</span> <span class="T2">(aq)</span> + 2 AgNO<span class="T2">3</span> <span class="T2">(aq)</span> <span class="T3"></span>  2 AgCl <span class="T2">(s)</span> + Ca(NO<span class="T2">3</span>)<span class="T2">2</span> <span class="T2">(aq)</span></p><p class="List_20_Paragraph"> </p><p class="List_20_Paragraph">When balancing these reactions, it is often best to treat polyatomic ions, like NO<span class="T2">3</span><span class="T4">-</span>, as single chemical species instead of focusing on their constituents, like nitrogen and oxygen. It is also helpful when balancing these reactions to know the charges of the anions and cations involved.</p><p class="List_20_Paragraph"> </p><ol><li><p class="P5" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">6.</span>Acid-base<span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li></ol><p class="P2">The unit on water will explore acids and bases with greater depth. For the purposes of reaction types, and acid can be identified by the fact that hydrogen atoms are listed first in the chemical formula.

Acid-base reactions always involve the formation of liquid water as a product.</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T1">Ionic Equations</span></p><p class="Standard">Reactions involving ions ca be written three different ways. This is because for example NaCl<span class="T2">(aq)</span> implies Na<span class="T4">+</span><span class="T2">(aq)</span> and Cl<span class="T4">-</span><span class="T2">(aq)</span> since ions separate into their ionic species when aqueous (as opposed to solid, when they are bonded together as a crystal).</p><p class="Standard">A <span class="T5">molecular</span> equation would be written as</p><p class="List_20_Paragraph"> </p><p class="P6">CaCl<span class="T2">2</span> <span class="T2">(aq)</span> + 2 AgNO<span class="T2">3</span> <span class="T2">(aq)</span> <span class="T3"></span>  2 AgCl <span class="T2">(s)</span> + Ca(NO<span class="T2">3</span>)<span class="T2">2</span> <span class="T2">(aq)</span></p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">However, the <span class="T5">total ionic</span> equation would be</p><p class="Standard">  Ca<span class="T4">2+</span><span class="T2">(aq)</span>  + 2 Cl<span class="T4">-</span> <span class="T2">(aq)</span> + 2 Ag<span class="T4">+</span><span class="T2">(aq)</span>  + 2 NO<span class="T2">3</span><span class="T4">-</span> <span class="T2">(aq)</span> <span class="T3"></span>  2 AgCl <span class="T2">(s)</span> + Ca<span class="T4">2+</span><span class="T2">(aq)</span> + 2 NO<span class="T2">3</span><span class="T4">-</span> <span class="T2">(aq)</span></p><p class="Standard">Notice that some of the ions are not directly involved in the chemical change.
