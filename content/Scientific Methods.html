Click on the text box to get the next clue, and see how many clues you need before you correctly guess the secret word:</span></p><p class="P6"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P7"><span class="T2">This word can be either a noun or an adjective.</span></p><p class="P10"> </p><p class="P6"><span class="T12">What does this riddle have to do with the natural sciences? Scientists are curious people who enjoy solving puzzles about how the world behaves. Unlike a brain teaser invented by a person, the problems of interest to scientists don’t have correct solutions printed in the back of a puzzle book. But like a puzzle expert, they don’t like being wrong, so scientists tend to be skeptical, collecting as many facts as possible and considering all the possibilities before committing to a tentative answer.</span></p><h1 class="P8"><a id="a__The_Rules_of_the_Game__The_Philosophy_of_Science"><span/></a><span class="T8"><br>The Rules of the Game: The Philosophy of Science</span></h1><p class="P10"> </p><p class="P6"><span class="T12">This puzzle could only be solved if every clue referred to the same word. If a false clue was included such as, “Rocks are made of this”, then there would be no correct answer at all. In the same way, the natural sciences begin with some basic assumptions about the fundamental character of the universe and how it functions.</span></p><p class="P10"> </p><p class="P6"><span class="T12">This ‘philosophy of science’ has developed over time with major contributions from Aristotle, Robert Boyle, and Rene Descartes. But one of the first natural philosophers to put all the pieces together and practice this philosophy was Sir Isaac Newton. Here are some of his most important assumptions.</span></p><p class="P10"> </p><ol><li><p class="P15" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">1.</span><span class="T12">The universe is consistent in all places and at all times.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P15" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">2.</span><span class="T12">There are laws governing the behavior of the natural world which cannot be broken and must be followed by the objects governed by them.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P15" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">3.</span><span class="T12">Explanations should be based only on the evidence as provided by nature and not speculations concerning what we would like to be true.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P15" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">4.</span><span class="T12">Complicated phenomena are the result of a few relatively simple principles which may be described mathematically.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P15" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">5.</span><span class="T12">These mathematical principles, when manipulated by the different fields of mathematics (algebra, geometry, calculus) will result in predictions that can be verified by experiment.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P15" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">6.</span><span class="T12">If predictions are not verified by experiment, then either our logic, principles, assumptions or mathematics must be wrong – not the universe.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li></ol><p class="P6"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P6"><span class="T12">The fourth statement was Newton’s greatest contribution to scientific understanding. And in fact his book, which laid the foundations of physics, is called Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. In Latin the title is </span><span class="T13">Philosophiae Naturalis de Principia Mathematica,</span><span class="T12"> or as it is more commonly called, the </span><span class="T13">Principia</span><span class="T12">.</span></p><p class="P6"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P6"><span class="T12">It is because of Newton’s faith in the power of mathematics when applied to the natural world, and his numerous examples of the method in action in his </span><span class="T13">Principia</span><span class="T12">, that we have scientific advances like air conditioning, electric lights, lasers, and robots on Mars. So in a very real sense, we are all Newtonian thinkers and scientists.</span></p><p class="P6"><span class="T4"> </span></p><h1 class="P13"><a id="a__Winning_the_Game__Scientific_Reasoning"><span/></a><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T17">Winning the Game: Scientific Reasoning</span></span></h1><p class="P6"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P1_borderStart"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T14">Curiosity leads naturally to exploration. If we are curious and don’t know, then we are motivated to find out. But what exactly are we trying to find out? Our ignorance (not a bad thing) is without direction. Exploring wherever our imagination takes us will help us find the correct direction.</span></span></p><p class="P1"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T14">As we explore we gather information. From that information, we discover patterns. The patterns help us develop tentative explanations – theories, hypotheses – about what is happening and why, what should happen next, or what should happen if we change the conditions of the system we are observing.</span></span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T5"> </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T14">One key characteristic that separates the natural sciences from other areas of human understanding is that the natural world is the final arbiter of what is true and what isn’t. Scientific theories must lead to predictions of what is not yet known; otherwise, they are not theories but philosophies. Predictions are tested by experiment. If results match the prediction, then there is reason to believe the theory is accurate. If not, then the theory is inaccurate and must be modified.</span></span></p><p class="P2"/><p class="P1"><span class="T11">Game Strategy: Laws and Theories</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T12">There is enough confusion about the definitions and relationship between laws and theories that it is worthwhile to devote a section of this discussion to them. Scientists avoid the words ‘prove’ and ‘true’. Both of these words assume absolutes and scientists (who don’t like to be wrong) try to avoid any indication that a theory is absolutely true. It is better to say that a theory is accurate or correct, and a scientist will often add, “within the limitations of the experimental conditions tested”.</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T12">Statements which are judged to be absolutely true are scientific laws. Laws have nothing whatsoever to do with human judgment or interpretation. A scientific law is a statement of what has been observed to happen in every single case, without exception.</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T12">Even laws may contain implied conditions. For example, the Second Law of Thermodynamics states:</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T13">When a hot body is placed in thermal contact with a cold body, heat spontaneously flows from the hot body to the cold body until both reach the same temperature.</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T12">We will assume that all the words and phrases in this statement such as ‘thermal contact’ and ‘temperature’ have been clearly defined. So what is this law saying? Hot things get cool and cold things get warm. This is a law of nature that we all understand because we experience it all the time.</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T12">But what about a refrigerator? Or an air conditioner? The inside of the refrigerator gets colder, not hotter; and an air conditioner ‘creates’ cold air. Has the Second Law been broken? No, because it includes the word, ‘spontaneously’. To make a refrigerator or air conditioner work, you have to supply energy to it (you plug it in). Without the energy input, you can’t make things cold. That’s why you might be eating a lot of ice cream if the power goes off in your kitchen for an extended period of time.</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T12">Another important Second Law in the physical sciences is Newton’s Second Law of Motion:</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T13">The acceleration of an object is proportional to the applied force, and inversely proportional to its mass.</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T12">In other words, if you push on an object, it goes faster. If an object is heavier (more massive), you have to push on it harder to get the same effect.</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T12">But then Albert Einstein introduced the theory of Special Relativity in 1905, and showed that an applied force may result in something other than an acceleration proportional to it. Does that mean the Second Law is no longer true? From the position of pure logic, the Second Law is not ‘true’. But it is so useful to us that we simply note that it is the limiting case of a more general law. The Second Law only applies when objects are traveling much slower than the speed of light. We don’t discard a useful principle that is shown not be to a law: we either </span><span class="T12">modify it or state the specific set of conditions for which it is true.</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T12">A theory is a tentative explanation as to the reason or cause for the scientific law. Theories may be all-encompassing and complicated, or specific and simple. There is a theory of stellar evolution which explains and describes how stars form, change, and die. But I may also have a theory as to why the leaves of my tomato plant are turning yellow. </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T4"> </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T12">If even scientific laws are subject to revision when further or contradictory observations are made, then certainly theories are always tentative: even the all-encompassing ones with predictions that have been verified by dozens of experiments. Laws and theories are related, but it is not the case that one is specifically and definitely linked to the other.</span></p><p class="P3"/><p class="P3_borderEnd"/><h1 class="P14"><a id="a__Getting_into_the_Game__Measurement"><span/></a><span class="T10">Getting into the Game: Measurement</span></h1><p class="P5"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"/></p><p class="Standard"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T15">Observations are the building blocks of the natural sciences. They can be qualitative or quantitative, and both types of observations are useful. But numbers are necessary if the fields of algebra and calculus are to be employed in scientific investigations. Numerical predictions are also more conclusive when determining if a theory is accurate or not.</span></span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T15">Numerical quantities are obtained by measurement. All measurements are uncertain: that means there is a limit to the number of digits that can be recorded in a measurement.</span></span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T15">A pencil may be 7.1 cm (centimeters) long, or 7.1245 cm long, or 7.12453667 cm long. But there will always be an unmeasured and unrecorded digit to the right of the last one shown in the measurement, and that is called the uncertainty.</span></span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T15">All digits 1-9 are significant, meaning they have been measured. But zeros may either be measured or they may just be placeholders based on the unit of measurement. For example, a pencil measured to be 7.1 cm long has two significant digits: the seven and the one. But the same pencil can be described as having a length of 71000 microns. The act of measurement isn’t different, so there should still be only two significant figures. The three ‘zeros’ are placeholders based on the choice of the measurement unit and powers of ten. The same would be true of the pencil length was recorded as 0.000071 kilometers: all of the zeros is this recorded value of the pencil’s length are placeholders.</span></span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T15">On the other hand, zeros between non-zero digits must be significant, like in the number 506 seconds. And trailing zeros past a decimal point must also be significant. For example, a golf ball may have a mass of 54 grams. But if the number is reported as 54.0 grams, then the zero must be significant because there is no other reason to record it except that the mass was measured to be closer to 54 grams than 54.1 grams or 53.9 grams. The result of arithmetic calculations will be the same whether 54 or 54.0 is entered into the calculation.</span></span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T15">The problem arises with numbers like 71000 microns. If a decimal point was added, 71000. microns, then the last zero is significant because there is no reason to include the decimal point except to tell the world that the last zero was measured, since the arithmetic would be the same with or without it. Therefore, the other two zeros between it and the 1 must also be significant because they lie between significant digits. But without the explicit decimal point, there is no indication if the last zero was measured or not.</span></span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T15">There are two ways to identify the uncertainty in a number with trailing zeros for measurements greater than one unit. One method is to state it directly: 71000 microns, +/- (read ‘plus or </span></span><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T15">minus') 1000 microns. That would mean to measurement was 71000 microns, not 70000 microns or 72000 microns, and only the seven and the one are measured and significant. But if the measurement is given as 71000 +/- 100 microns, then the first zero is also significant because the measurement was between 70900 and 71100 microns. When making the measurement, the best reading for the third digit was a ‘0‘, not a ‘1’ or a ‘9’.</span></span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T15">If the measurement was 71000 +/- 10 microns, then the first two zeros are significant, If the measurement was 71000 +/- 1 micron, then all three zeros are significant and there are five significant digits in the answer. The actual length of the object would have been between 69999 and 71001 microns.</span></span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="theme-text-font-body1"><span class="T15">A simpler way to deal with the issue is to never have zeros as placeholders at all. This is what scientific notation does for us. A number written in scientific notation has one non-zero digit and then a decimal point. (If the measurement has only one significant digit, then the decimal point can be omitted.) All remaining digits, zero or non-zero, are following the decimal point, so they must be significant. If the zero is between two non-zero digits or a zero that is significant, it must also be significant. If it trails the number, it must be significant because there is no reason to include it unless it was measured. The addition of ten raised to a power in scientific notation creates the placeholder. So 7.1 x 10</span></span><span class="theme-text-font-body1"><span class="T18">4</span></span><span class="theme-text-font-body1"><span class="T15"> microns would show that the measurement has two significant figures, but 7.10 x 10</span></span><span class="theme-text-font-body1"><span class="T16">4</span></span><span class="theme-text-font-body1"><span class="T15"> microns would show three significant digits.</span></span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T15">There are also rules concerning mathematical operations on measurements. When multiplying or dividing, take the least number of significant digits in the final answer. (Don’t round calculations until the last step.) When adding or subtracting, record the answer to the least accurate column. So the answer to 7.13 cm x 2.6 cm would be 19 cm</span></span><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T19">2</span></span><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T15">, but 7.13 cm + 2.6 cm would be recorded as 9.7 cm.</span></span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="theme-text-color-3-3"><span class="T15">There is also confusion about the scientific definitions of the terms ‘accuracy’ and ‘precision’ A measurement within a range of +/- 1 micron is much more precise than one within a range of +/- 1000 microns. But part of our philosophy of science is that the universe is consistent, so the pencil must have some actual, unique length, even if it is impossible for our human senses to ‘know’ it with perfect certainty. Suppose we knew the actual length of the pencil was 7.4 cm as a 'perfect' number. (A perfect number, like one dozen = 12, has an infinite number of significant digits.) If that was the case, then it wouldn’t matter if the pencil was measured as 7.1000 cm with a precision to the closest micron: it would still be less accurate than someone else’s measurement of the pencil as 7.3 cm with only two significant digits, because the second measurement is closer to the correct length.</span></span></p></div></body></html>
