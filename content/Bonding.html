When a person puts their fingers in the sleeves of the braided tube, pulling your fingers out only tightens the grip. When atoms combine together to form a substance, some force must be keeping them in place. The result of these interatomic forces holding atoms near each other is a <span class="T2">chemical bond</span>. </p><p class="Standard">Although the finger puzzle may seem simple, the correct way to get your fingers out is not obvious. And although a basic understanding of chemical bonding is relatively clear once the properties of interatomic forces are understood, a complete explanation includes a branch of modern physics called quantum<a id="_GoBack"/> mechanics. Quantum mechanics is subtle, seemingly contradictory, and extremely mathematical. For those reasons, no attempt will be made to explain the <span class="T2">why</span> of quantum mechanics as it applies to atoms, only to summarize the principles that affect chemical bonding. </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">Electrostatic Forces in Atoms</span></p><p class="Standard">Michael Faraday recognized in the 1830’s that charge was associated with matter. He was a major contributor to the field of electrochemistry; Faraday was the person who proposed the words ‘electrode’, ‘anode’ and ‘cathode’ that are still associated with batteries today. </p><p class="Standard">If matter is composed atoms, then this conjecture implies that atoms must possess charge. Since charge comes in two types, and since samples of matter don’t normally demonstrate the attractions and repulsions of electrostatic force, then positive and negative charge must be equally balanced in a neutral atom. Therefore, ‘charging’ a glass by rubbing it with wool must cause some atoms to lose charge and other atoms to gain it. Faraday called a charged atom an ‘ion’, with a negatively-charged ion called an <span class="T2">anion</span> and a positively-charged one a <span class="T2">cation</span>.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">Atoms and Ions</span></p><p class="Standard">Svante Arrhenius in his 1887 doctoral dissertation proposed that some atoms are more stable in their charged state than in their neutral state. He thought that ions could explain why some aqueous solutions, like salt water, conducted electricity while others, like sugar solutions, did not. An ion surrounded by water molecules would be free to move, and thus current could flow. </p><p class="Standard">However, if the sodium and chloride atoms in table salt were <span class="T2">already</span> ions in the solid form, then a molten salt should also conduct electricity since ions in the solid state are in fixed positions but would be free to move in a liquid state. And it turns out, molten table salt does conduct electricity, supporting the theory. Therefore, a solid composed of ions is known as an <span class="T2">ionic salt</span>.</p><p class="Standard">Arrhenius’s 56 propositions on his theory of electrolytes were not well-received by his dissertation committee, but most of them are still accepted today. In 1903, he received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">The Nuclear Atom</span></p><p class="Standard">In 1896, James Joseph Thomson concluded from experimental observations that negative charges in an atom could be ejected as particles with mass. He was able to demonstrate that the particles had identical mass and charge, no matter type of atom produced them.  Another physicist, George Fitzgerald, suggested calling these charged particles <span class="T2">electrons</span>. </p><p class="Standard">In 1909, Robert Millikan demonstrated that electric charge came in discrete units; we use the symbol <span class="T2">e</span> to stand for this basic unit of charge. He also determined that the mass of the electron is almost 2000 times less than the mass of hydrogen, the smallest atom. This is like comparing the mass of an elephant to the mass of a fly. Therefore, most of the mass of an atom is <span class="T3">not</span> contained in the electrons but in the positively-charged part of the atom.</p><p class="Standard">In 1914, Ernest Rutherford showed that most of the mass and all of the positive charge is located in the center of the atom, which he called the nucleus. From his data, he concluded that the size of the nucleus was 1000 times smaller than the atom itself. </p><p class="Standard">If the nucleus was the size of a marble on the fifty-yard line of a football field, then the edge of the atom would extend to the goal posts. However, since atoms are three-dimensional and mostly spherical, a better model is to imagine spinning the 100 yards in a circle then flipping the circle over to make a hemisphere above ground and an identical one below ground. That is a more realistic comparison of the volume of the nucleus and the volume of the atom.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">Electronic Structure</span></p><p class="Standard">The nuclear atom immediately implies that chemical bonding involves only the negatively-charged electrons and not the positively-charged nucleus since the electrons are both light (requiring less for to move them) and occupy most of the outer volume of the atom. We also have evidence that electrons can be ejected from atoms, but not positive charges. If fact, the best experimental data suggest that electrons are point-like particles with no internal structure: they are not like marbles, or bb’s, or beads but mathematical points that take up no volume. </p><p class="Standard">The implications of this model are significant. A carbon atom, for example, is occupied by six point-like electrons somehow moving in a large volume of otherwise empty space. And yet those same six electrons not only determine the overall size of the atom but the character of the chemical bonds formed by carbon.</p><p class="Standard">The behavior of electrons in an atom can’t be random. The similarities between the properties of elements in a group such as the noble gasses or the alkali metals suggest the source of chemical interactions, the electrons, must have some structure within the atom. An early model of the atom suggested that electrons might orbit the massive nucleus in the same way that planets orbit the sun. However, the full description of electronic structure is much more complicated than that and is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics. The current model suggests that electrons don’t orbit the nucleus in fixed paths but tend to occupy certain regions of the atom more often than others. The current model is a statistical one that only makes predictions about where the electrons are most likely to be located, what the average velocity might be, and the possible energy one might have if the energy was measured. The name we give to the distribution of a particular electron in the volume of the atom is its <span class="T2">orbital</span>.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">Quantum Numbers</span></p><p class="Standard">Only knowing statistical probabilities and not exact answers of where, when and how much is a consequence of quantum mechanics. At the heart of quantum theory is the concept of a <span class="T2">quantum number</span>. Quantum numbers <span class="T3">define</span> the electron and all the properties and behaviors associated with the electron. In a very real sense, to know an electron’s quantum numbers is to know the electron.</p><p class="Standard">The properties of electrons, including their positions and motions within the atom and their energies, are determined by a set of four quantum numbers. No two electrons within an atom have the exact same set of quantum numbers.</p><p class="Standard">One of the four quantum numbers is called the principal quantum number, symbolized as n. Its value determines the total number of combinations in the set. The allowed values of the principle quantum number are n = 1, 2, 3, … The principle quantum number has the greatest influence on both the size and the energy of the electron.</p><p class="Standard">A second quantum number, labeled l, is related to the shape of the orbital. The number of different shapes is equal to n: there is only one spherically-shaped orbital for n=1; two (a spherical shape and a dumb-bell shape) for n=2; those two shapes plus a clover-leaf shape for n=3, etc.</p><p class="Standard">The third quantum number, labeled m, describes the orientation of the orbital. The number of orientations depends on the second quantum number. There is one orientation for the spherical shape; three orientations for the dumb-bell shape, and five for the clover leaf shape.</p><p class="Standard">The fourth quantum number, called spin, comes in two types. The values for spin are either + ½ or – ½.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">Electron structure and the periodic chart</span></p><p class="Standard">The rules for quantum numbers determine the number of electrons that make up a complete set, or <span class="T2">shell</span>. Electrons located in an incomplete shell are called valence electrons. Once a shell is complete, there is a significant change in the energy of the electrons of the next set as well as the average distance of the electrons from the nucleus. There is also a change in energy when a subset is complete, but not to the same degree.</p><p class="Standard">All alkali metals have one valence electron. The lms quantum numbers of the valence electron are all the same, only the value of n is different. All alkaline metals have two valence electrons while all halogens are one electron short of a shell. All noble gases have a complete shell, and that is why they very rarely form chemical bonds.</p><p class="Standard">The patterns determined by the electronic quantum numbers are the reason for the structure of the periodic table. There are only two electrons associated with the first l quantum number, and that quantum number is associated with the first two columns: the alkali and alkaline metals. The next value of l has six possible combinations of m and s (3 x 2 = 6). Note that there are six elements carbon – neon, as well as all the elements below them in their families. The third value of l has ten possible combinations of m and s, and there are ten elements from Yttrium to zinc. The fourteen elements in the section near the bottom of the chart correspond to a complete subset of electrons for the fourth value of l.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"/><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">Periodic Trends</span></p><p class="Standard">Imagine a lithium atom with three positive charges in its nucleus and three electrons. The first two electrons form a shell, while the third is a valence electron. For the most part, the valence electron is determining the size of the atom.</p><p class="Standard">Beryllium has two valence electrons but four positive charges in the nucleus. The larger force of attraction pulls the electrons in closer to the nucleus, (although there is some repulsion between the electrons pushing them apart). As more pairs of positive and negative charges are added to make the next atom in the period, the greater positive charge of the nucleus pulls all electrons, especially valence electrons, inward.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Periodic trend 1:  As one moves from left to right across a period, the size of the atom shrinks.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Periodic trend 2: As one moves from left to right across a period, the attraction of the nucleus for the electrons increases.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Element 10, Neon, completes the shell. The eleventh electron and the eleventh atom, sodium, begins a new shell. Like lithium, it has one valence electron. But since the principal quantum number has changed, the valence electron is much farther away from the nucleus and therefore more weakly held than the lithium’s valence electron.</p><p class="Standard">The force of attraction between the nucleus and its outermost electron can be measured by the <span class="T2">ionization energy</span>: the amount of energy needed to completely remove an electron from an atom or ion.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Periodic trend 3: As one moves down a group (column) the size of the atom increases.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Periodic trend 4: As one moves down a group (column) the ionization energy decreases.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Periodic trend 5: As one moves from left to right across a period, the ionization energy increases because the atomic size get smaller.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Another way to characterize the ability of an atom to attract electrons is a measure called <span class="T2">electronegativity</span>. The noble gasses with complete shells don’t attract electrons. The element with the strongest attraction for electrons is fluorine because it is the smallest of the halogens with one valence electron short of a complete shell.</p><p class="Standard">Periodic trend 6: The element with the greatest electronegativity is fluorine; the one with the smallest electronegativity is francium. Electronegativity decreases as one moves away from fluorine and toward francium.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">The Ionic Bond</span></p><p class="Standard">A sodium atom has one valence electron that is much farther away from the nucleus than the other ten electrons. It is weakly held by the +10 charge of the nucleus. A chlorine atom is one electron short of a complete shell and holds onto its seven valence electrons much more strongly than sodium, since it has +17 charge in the nucleus. Not only is the charge greater, but the electrons are at a closer distance to the nucleus.</p><p class="Standard">Suppose a neutral sodium atom approaches a neutral chlorine atom. Sodium’s valence electron falls under the influence of the chlorine nucleus. The much greater attractive electrostatic force causes the electron to be <span class="T2">transferred</span> from the sodium atom to the chlorine atom, and two ions are formed. Since the electrostatic force is very strong and two charged ions are attracted to each other and an <span class="T2">ionic bond</span> has formed.</p><p class="Standard">Electrostatic force is non-directional: a sodium cation is equally attracted to all nearby chloride anions. There is no ‘sodium chloride molecule’, only a sodium chloride formula unit. Think of a chessboard composed of black and white squares. Although the basic unit is one white square and one black square, any two neighboring squares can be designated as the basic unit.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">The Covalent Bond</span></p><p class="Standard">Consider two chlorine atoms; both need one electron to complete the shell. However, both have an equal attractive force for each other’s valence electrons. It is not possible for one electron to be transferred to the other atom. Instead, quantum theory allows for the possibility of <span class="T2">sharing</span> electrons. The cooperative sharing of valence electrons results in covalent bonds.</p><p class="Standard">Unlike ionic bonds, electrons participating in a covalent bond spend most of their time in the region of space between the two nuclei that are involved in the sharing. And the sharing doesn’t have to be perfectly equal. Electrons can spend more time, on average, near the nucleus of the atom with the greater attractive force, which is measured by electronegativity. A molecule with the center of the positive charge in a different location than the center of the negative charge is said to have a dipole and is called a polar molecule. The larger the electronegativity difference between the nuclei, the larger the dipole. A symmetric molecule, or one with small electronegativity difference, is a non-polar molecule.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">The Metallic Bond </span></p><p class="Standard">Lithium atoms are able to interact with other lithium atoms. Instead of transferring electrons, they tend to share them in their valence shells, forming a <span class="T2">metallic bond</span>. Because the electrostatic force is weak, the electrons are able to move from one atom to another; the ability of metals to conduct electricity is one of their defining properties. </p><p class="Standard">This also means that metal atoms are not stuck in fixed locations, since the outer electrons are in spherically-shaped orbitals. This is unlike ionic salts, which are held in place by the neighboring ions of opposite charge, of the covalently bonded molecules which have fixed shapes due to the localization of the electrons. Therefore, metals can be pounded into thin sheets or pulled into thin wires. Striking an ionic salt with crack it. Depending on the interaction between the molecules, a molecular solid can either crack, or shatter, or deform.</p><p class="Standard">Although metal atoms are able to relocate, the metallic bond itself is very strong, which is why metals (like ionic salts) melt at very high temperatures. </p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
