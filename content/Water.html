As a water-based planet and water-based life, many important and common chemical reactions occur in water as a solvent. Water is such an important substance that many physical quantities are based on water as a standard: the density of water is 1.000 g/mL, and the original unit of heat, the calorie, was the amount of heat it took to raise one gram of water one degree Celsius.</p><p class="Standard">The physical properties of water are sometimes quite different from other similar substances. For example, the density of most solid substances is greater than the liquid phase, so solids sink as a substance freezes. But the density of ice is less than liquid water, so ice floats. This fact has a number of environmental implications. </p><p class="Standard">The especially strong intermolecular attractions between water molecules, called hydrogen bonds, cause water to boil at a much higher temperature than periodic trends would predict. Hydrogen bonding is also responsible for a heat capacity that is four times larger than the range of other substances that are liquid at room temperature. And the large dipole moment of the water molecule means that it can interact strongly with other polar substances, which is why it is called the universal solvent. </p><p class="Standard">But the focus of this introduction to water will center on the fact that water can react with itself, leading to the phenomenon of acid-base chemistry.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">Concentration</span></p><p class="Standard">Before exploring the chemical nature of water, it is necessary to introduce the measurement of concentration. Imagine a mixture of two pure substances. If the two chemical species mix completely at all levels, down to the interactions between individual molecules and ions, then the mixture is said to be <span class="T2">homogeneous</span>. Another name for a homogeneous mixture is a <span class="T2">solution</span>. Salt water is an example of a solution. So is air. An alloy like bronze is a solid solution of copper and tin.</p><p class="Standard">The major component of a solution is the <span class="T2">solvent</span> and the minor component is the <span class="T2">solute</span>. If the solvent is water, the mixture is called an <span class="T2">aqueous</span> solution, and that is the reason for the phase label, (aq). </p><p class="Standard">It is important to be able to quantify the amount of solute in a solution, which is the <span class="T2">concentration</span> of the solute. The amount of the solute or solvent could be expressed in either mass or moles. The total amount of the mixture could be expressed as total mass, total moles, or total volume. The preferred measure of concentration in aqueous solutions is <span class="T2">molarity</span>, defined as</p><!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.--><div class="Standard"><!--Next '

For example, 3.0 M NaOH means that the concentration of sodium hydroxide is 3.0 moles of sodium hydroxide per liter of solution. The correct phrasing would be to say, “We have a 3.0 Molar solution”.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="T3">The symbol for concentration is square brackets. For this example,</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T3">[NaOH] = 3.0 M</span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="T3">A simple algebraic re-arrangement of the definition of molarity shows that the moles of a solute in a sample of a solution is the product of the volume in liters and the concentration of the solution:</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T3">moles = M x volume</span></p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">The self-ionization of water</span></p><p class="Standard">Neutral hydrogen atoms possess only one electron. The positively-charged nucleus of the atom is called a proton. The hydrogen-oxygen bond in water molecules is covalent and the oxygen has the greater electronegativity, meaning the electrons of the bond spend more of their time near the oxygen atom than the hydrogen atom.</p><p class="Standard">Each oxygen atom has two sets of non-bonding electron pairs in the valence shell. Because the pairs are not part of a covalent bond, they occupy a relatively large space around the oxygen atom. It can be helpful to think of the hydrogen atom as an exposed proton sitting on top of the electron orbital. When encountering the non-bonding electron orbitals of a neighboring oxygen atom, it is possible for the electron to break its current bond and form a new one with the other oxygen atom. </p><p class="Standard">Because the proton has left its electron behind, one of the two new chemical species is negatively charged, and the other is positively charged. The chemical reaction can be written as:</p><p class="P1">H<span class="T4">2</span>O + H<span class="T4">2</span>O <span class="T6"></span> H<span class="T4">3</span>O<span class="T7">+</span> + OH<span class="T7">-</span></p><p class="Standard">The first ion, the cation, is called the hydronium ion, and the anion is called the hydroxide ion.</p><p class="Standard">When first encountering the concept of acids and bases, the self-ionization of water is often written as  </p><p class="P1">H<span class="T4">2</span>O <span class="T6"></span> H<span class="T7">+</span> + OH<span class="T7">-</span></p><p class="Standard">Thinking of a water molecule splitting into two parts can be conceptually helpful, and sometimes we will write expressions using H<span class="T7">+</span> for simplicity, but in terms of the real chemistry, the statement is incorrect. It is not possible for protons to move freely through a water solution: they are always attached to an oxygen atom.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">Equilibrium</span></p><p class="Standard">The self-ionization of water was written as a reversible reaction with a double arrow. If it is possible for two neutral water molecules to transfer a hydrogen in, then it is certain possible for opposite-charged ions electrostatically attracted to each other to transfer the ion back again. In fact, the actual percentage of water molecules that undergo self-ionization is extremely small.</p><p class="Standard">Every reversible reaction has some reactants and some products co-existing in the chemical environment where the reaction is taking place, whether it is a beaker, the atmosphere, or the blood stream. If external conditions are stabilized, then the relative proportions of reactants and products will stabilize and the reaction is said to be in equilibrium. This type of equilibrium is said to be a <span class="T2">dynamic</span> one because reactants are continually becoming products and products are continually becoming reactants.</p><p class="Standard">There is a comprehensive mathematical study of equilibrium. Every chemical equilibrium has an equilibrium expression, related to the concentrations of reactants and products. The ratio of products over reactants, when expressed correctly, is equal to a constant, given the symbol K, that must always be true when the system is in equilibrium. This means that the concentrations of reactants and products in equilibrium are never fixed, but altering the amount of one substance will necessarily alter the other concentrations until equilibrium is restored: the ratio of product and reactant concentrations is equal to the equilibrium constant once again.</p><p class="Standard">The equilibrium expression for the self-ionization of water is</p><!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.--><div class="P1"><!--Next '
