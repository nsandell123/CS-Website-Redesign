One of the first video games, Pong, was just a dot moving at constant speed between two paddles. Donkey Kong tossed barrels down a ramp, and Mario jumped up into the air to capture jewels. Even Angry Birds is just a modern update of Bananas, where two gorillas threw exploding bananas at each other: both games are based on the simple physics of projectile motion.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T16">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T4">But itâs not just video games. Amusement park rides are about rising and falling, spinning and turning, speeding up and slowing down. And on the playground, tag is about running, jump rope is about jumping, and with dodge ball, we are back to Angry Birds.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T16">Â </span></p><p class="P3_borderEnd"><span class="T6">Key concept: ALL subjects in physics are linked to motion as the bottom line: causing things to move or to change their motion.</span></p><p class="Standard">Â </p><p class="Standard">Â </p><p class="Standard">Â </p><h1 class="P2"><a id="a__Generalized_Motion"><span/></a><span class="T14">Generalized Motion</span></h1><p class="Standard">Â </p><p class="P1_borderStart"><span class="T5">Watch this short video of a mechanical toy.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">The video demonstrates that interesting motions can appear to be very complicated. So how do we describe them?</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">In the study of motion, physicists have discovered that any complicated motion can always be subdivided into three mutually exclusive categories. </span><span class="T5">Translation</span><span class="T3"> is moving from one point in space to another; it can occur in one, two or three dimensions. </span><span class="T5">Rotation</span><span class="T3"> is motion around a fixed point. This motion is always two-dimensional and unlike translation, the object doesnât actually âgetâ anywhere. And an object doesnât âgetâ anywhere, either, with </span><span class="T5">vibration</span><span class="T3">. Instead of moving in circles, the object moves back-and-forth in a straight line about a fixed point.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3_borderEnd"><span class="T3">For the purposes of this introduction to motion, we will only consider translational motion in one dimension, while vibrational motion will be explored in a another Unit. In a full physics course, projectile motion (a specific type of two-dimensional motion), circular motion, and rotational motion are also studied as separate topics.</span></p><h1 class="P2"><a id="a__The_Elements_of_Motion"><span/></a><span class="T2">The Elements of Motion</span></h1><p class="P5_borderStart"/><p class="P3"><span class="T3">A scientist doesnât want to just </span><span class="T7">describe</span><span class="T3"> motion but to understand it and </span><span class="T7">master</span><span class="T3"> it. That implies quantifying motion and its key elements.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">The first fundamental element of motion is time. The experience of motion doesnât make any sense without the passage of time. Time may be measured in minutes, hours, days or years, but for most applications the second is the standard unit of time.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">The second element is location. The measurement of location requires an origin. The origin is completely arbitrary and determined by the investigator, although some origins are more useful than others. The Cartesian coordinate system is a useful method for describing the location of an object in a two-dimensional space. The distance of an object from the origin to its location can be measured with any unit of length, but the meter (or centimeter) is commonly used in laboratory situations. In this course, </span><span class="T7">the English units of inches, feet or yards are NEVER used to measure distances!</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">The location of an object has two parts: a magnitude and a direction. There are so many quantities in physics that are described by both a magnitude and a direction that our general name for them is </span><span class="T7">vectors</span><span class="T3">. Quantities with magnitude only are </span><span class="T7">scalars</span><span class="T3">. Time is an example of a scalar quantity, since statements such as âten seconds to the leftâ or âtwo weeks Northâ donât make any sense. Location is a vector because âthree steps forwardâ does make sense and means something very different than âthree steps backâ.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">Direction is extremely important in the physical sciences but it isnât often mentioned in early introductions to the natural sciences. However, anyone who has ever planned a trip or employed a GPS system knows that it makes a big difference turning left at a stop light than right, or traveling east instead of north. Or imagine following someone in a car moving thirty miles an hour, as opposed to meeting them at the same speed in a head-on collision. Direction makes a difference.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15"><br/></span><span class="T3">A vector quantity is often identified by two separate and independent measures butÂ a scalar by only one. The vector </span><span class="T3">quantity measuring location is </span><span class="T7">displacement</span><span class="T3">; its scalar counterpart is </span><span class="T7">distance</span><span class="T3">. The distance of the object from the origin in this figure is 5 meters. The displacement could be described by the (x, y) coordinate of (3, 4) [+3 meters in the x-direction and +4 meters in the y-direction], or as 5 meters at a 53 degree angle. The common system is to measure angles counter-clockwise with respect to the positive x-axis. Whether using x- and y-components or a magnitude/direction combination, two quantities are needed to uniquely specify the vector.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15"><br/></span><span class="T3">The actual motion of an object through space is described by the vector quantity of </span><span class="T7">velocity</span><span class="T3">. Its scalar counterpart is </span><span class="T7">speed</span><span class="T3">. Velocity is defined as a change in displacement over time; speed is a change in distance over time.</span></p><p class="P3_borderEnd"><span class="T15"><br/></span><span class="T3">A fourth quantity of major importance in the study of motion is </span><span class="T7">acceleration</span><span class="T3">. Acceleration is speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. Acceleration is defined as a change in velocity over time and it is always a vector. Negative acceleration is NOT the same thing as slowing down, because slowing down describes how the magnitude of the vector is changing, not its direction in space.</span></p><p class="Standard">Â </p><h1 class="P2"><a id="a__Representations_of_Motion"><span/></a><span class="T2">Representations of Motion</span></h1><p class="P3_borderStart"><span class="T3">Because motion can be complicated and because position, velocity or acceleration can be different at each measured instance of time, physicists have developed methods to represent motion that have proven to be useful for describing and understanding the motion of objects. The one that probably comes to mind first is describing motion by equations. Although algebraic manipulation is a powerful tool in the study of motion, it should be the </span><span class="T7">last</span><span class="T3">representation method employed in the investigation of motion, not the first.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T5">Beginning with Words and Pictorial Descriptions</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">Think of some words that can be used to describe the motion of the ladybug in the video. Spinning, turning, and flipping are some examples. The first step to working with a specific example of motion is to describe it in a sentence. The word description focuses the mind on what is important about the motion and identifies which of the three categories of motion apply to the situation at hand.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">Since motion is about changing location in space, a pictorial description also makes a lot of sense. If there are two or more objects involved, then a drawing can show how they are situated in relation to each other. And if direction is important, arrows can be used to show the direction of velocity or acceleration.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T5">Representing Movement in Motion Diagrams</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">A motion diagram is a series of pictures show the location of the object in equal time intervals. An arrow is attached to each picture to show the direction of the velocity at that point in time, with the length of the arrow representing the relative speed. An acceleration vector can also be attached to the picture or drawn near it. A motion diagram can represent either one-dimensional or two-dimensional motion.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T5">Presenting Data in Graphs</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">The position, velocity, and acceleration of an object at particular times can be presented in a data table, but most people donât process lists of data very well since most of us are visually oriented. However, that same information becomes understandable if it is plotted in graphs of position, velocity or acceleration as a function of time. A series of data points in a graph shows the sequence of position or changes in velocity or acceleration over time sequentially. The mind, through what the eye sees, has a better sense of how the object âmovesâ in a graph, even though the graph is static and the object is not </span><span class="T3">moving. Understanding in the sciences often requires imagination.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T5">Summarizing Relationships in Equations</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">As mentioned in the unit on Scientific Methods, one of the foundational principles of the Newtonian philosophy is that algebra applied to equations describing an object or a system will lead to accurate predictions of behavior and results. But an equation is not just a set of letters and symbols separated by an equal sign. An equation is mathematical shorthand for a concepts. An equation has no meaning by itself: it is given meaning when those letters are linked to objects and their behaviors, and the symbols are linked to mathematical actions.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">An equation is like a paragraph written in a foreign language: if you </span><span class="T7">do</span><span class="T3"> know how to read the language, then a paragraph could be a translation of the Gettysburg address or Hamletâs soliloquy. If you </span><span class="T7">donât</span><span class="T3"> know the language, then the passage is just a rectangle filled with letters and spaces.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3_borderEnd"><span class="T3">Just as a word or pictorial description is the first step to examining a physical science problem concerning motion, thinking through the meaning of each letter as an equation is being written down is the first step to actually being able to use equations and algebra to any degree of success when using solving the problem mathematically.</span></p><p class="Standard">Â </p><p class="Standard">Â </p><p class="Standard">Â </p><h1 class="P2"><a id="a__Putting_It_All_Together__An_Example"><span/></a><span class="T2">Putting It All Together: An Example</span></h1><p class="P5_borderStart"/><p class="P3"><span class="T3">Tony is dating Melissa.

Where and when does Tony catch up to Melissa?</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">The problem already presents a word description of the motion.

Since there are two objects, each with its own position, velocity, and acceleration,Â  a âTâ or an âMâ has been added to identify the phsical quantity for each person. The label âfâ mean âfinalâ, which is usually the last step when the problem is completed. An attempt has been made to include all the numerical information in the picture as well as clearly identify what we are looking for (when the problem is solved) with question marks.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">The origin could have been either Tonyâs or Melissaâs initial position, or some other arbitrary point. The final result of where they meet will be the same, but the numerical value associated with that location will be different depending on the origin: add twenty meters to it to find Tonyâs walking distance if Melissaâs location is chosen as the origin; subtract twenty from it to find Melissaâs walking distance if Tonyâs location is the origin. But the actual distances walked by Tony and Melissa do not depend on the choice of the origin.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">Because we are interested in the distance Tony travelled, we will use his starting point as the origin.

The steps for constructing one are given elsewhere, but the one drawn here shows that Tony is travelling greater distances as time progresses, and his speed is also increasing because the velocity vector arrow is getting longer. The text âv=0â is used to show that Tony started from rest. The arrow above Tonyâs motion is his constant acceleration.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T15">Â </span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">Melissa, on the other hand, has an acceleration of zero, so her pictures are equally spaced and the velocity vector arrow does not change in length or direction. Her acceleration is also specified as âa=0â.
