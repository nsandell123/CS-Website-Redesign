Can you identify the basic repeating unit in the pattern? Can you identify the number of each geometric shape in the repeating unit?</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Here is an isoprene unit. It consists of four carbon atoms in a row with a fifth carbon atom forming a branch. Isoprene units can be found in many biochemical substances. Can you identify all of the isoprene units in beta-carotene?</p><p class="Standard">Chemistry is about the composition of matter, and how the properties of matter are affected by changes in composition or external conditions. Therefore, typically the first step of a chemical investigation is to analyze the composition of a pure substance. In fact, composition is often the most important property worth knowing about, because knowledge of composition can lead to predictions of other properties.</p><p class="Standard">The first part of this unit explores methods for determining composition and manipulating the quantities of pure substances taking part in a reation or the formation of a substance. The topic is called <span class="T2">stoichiometry</span> from the Greek meaning ‘element measure’ and includes the definition of a new counting number, the <span class="T2">mole</span>. The second part introduces the common shorthand used to identify the types and number of elements in a compound, the chemical formula. Chemical formulas sometimes include useful clues about the structure of the compound as well. The third part of this topic is a primer on simple chemical nomenclature, or the naming of compounds.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">Relative atomic mass</span></p><p class="Standard">The concept of relative atomic mass is crucial to atomic theory. If matter consists of atoms, then they must combine as whole units and the composition of a given compound can be described by the ratio of the components. However, there is no experimental method for directly measuring the number or atoms or molecules in a sample of a substance. Even if that was possible, experimental evidence shows that the number of atoms in even a microgram sample of any substance is astronomically huge. What can be measured is mass, and Dalton’s inspiration was to use relative atomic mass to eliminate the ‘mass effect’ when determining chemical composition.</p><p class="Standard"/><p class="Standard">Let’s begin with an analogy. Suppose we had a sealed box of paper clips, and we wanted to know the number of clips in the box. It isn’t possible to open the box and count then, just as it isn’t possible to count the number of atoms in a sample of a pure substance. But suppose the average mass of a single paper clip is 1.0 grams, and the mass of the paper clips (minus the mass of the box itself) is 455 grams. Then a reasonable conclusion is that there are 455 paper clips in the box.</p><p class="Standard">Now suppose instead of paper clips the box contained washers, which have an average mass of 5.0 grams each. We can conclude that the number or washers in the box is 455/5 = 91 washers. We eliminate the mass effect by dividing the mass by the average mass of a single object.</p><p class="Standard">We can apply this logic to chemistry and stoichiometry. Suppose a 36.66 gram sample of a substance containing only carbo and oxygen can be descomposed into 10.00 g of carbon and 26.66 g of oxygen. According to the modern periodic table, carbon has been assigned a relative mass of 12.0 amu (atomic mass units) and oxygen a value of 16.0 amu. Dividing 10.0 g of carbon by its relative mass of 12.00 results in 0.83 relative counting units. Doing the same for oxygen gives 1.66 relative counting units. Since the ratio of oxygen to carbon in terms of counting units is 2:1, the substance must have two oxygen atoms for every carbon atom in a single molecule, or CO<span class="T3">2.</span></p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">Relative mass, counting units, and the mole</span></p><p class="Standard">The goal of stoichiometry is to convert from what can be measured, such as the mass of a substance, into the number of atoms or molecules in a sample. In order to use the methods of dimensional analysis correctly, we really need to know the mass of a single atom of carbon or oxygen or some other element in grams, not atomic mass units. It is certainly possible to convert the mass mass of an atom from one unit to other, including atomic mass units to grams, but as mentioned before, the mass of a single atom is extremely small so the number of atoms in even a small sample of matter is astronomical. Therefore, determining the actual number of atoms is a sample of matter is not very helpful. </p><p class="Standard">We simplify stoichiometry by defining a new counting unit, the mole. In the previous example, 10 g of carbon is 0.83 moles of carbon, and 26.66 g of oxygen is 1.66 moles of oxygen. A mole is defined as the number of particles needed such that the relative atomic of an element is equal to that number of grams. For example, one mole of hydrogen atoms has a mass of 1.01 grams. But one mole of carbon atoms must have a mass of 12.01 grams, and one more of oxygen 16.00 grams.</p><p class="Standard">Consider the analogy of paper clips and washers again. A dozen is a counting unit equal to twelve. One dozen paper clips (12 paper clips) will have a mass of 12 g, but a dozen washers will have a mass of 60 grams. Washers are five times heavier than paper clips, so the mass of an equal number of washers is five times heavier than that number of paper clips.</p><p class="Standard">The choice of the gram as the unit of mass for defining the mole was arbitrary. A different mass unit could have been used, such as a ton. Whatever the number of atoms it would take to make a mole based on a ton, it would still be true that 12 tons of carbon would have the same number of atoms as 16 tons of oxygen.</p><p class="Standard">That implies that the actual number of atoms it takes to make a mole of an element based on the gram is not that significant, just expedient. Even so, it still seems reasonable to ask the question, how big is a mole? If the gram is used as the unit of mass, the number of atoms in one mole of any substance is 602,000,000,000,000,000,000; or in scientific notation, 1 mole = 6.02 x 10<span class="T4">23</span> items.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">Chemical formulas</span></p><p class="Standard">Jacob Berzelius is credited with creating the system used to represent chemical formulas used today, with a few minor variations.

Here are the nomenclature rules.</p><ol><li><p class="P4" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">1.</span>In a compound consisting of a metal and a nonmetal, the name of the metal comes first and is unchanged, followed by a name based on nonmetal.<span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P4" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">2.</span>If the non-metal is a group of atoms behaving as a chemical species, the name of the chemical species is unchanged.<span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P4" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">3.</span>If the compound consists of two non-metals, prefixes are used to identify how many of each atom are present in the formula. One atom is rarely identified in the name, although the prefix ‘mono’ may be used for that purpose.<span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P4" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">4.</span>In a compound consists of two non-metals, the first nonmetal is named with no changes and the second nonmetal employs the name used for that nonmetal.<span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P4" style="margin-left:1.27cm;"><span style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">5.</span>Prefixes are never used for compounds containing metals.
